# Understanding Web Infrastructure

## Background Context

As Full-Stack Software Engineers, we navigate through different layers of the software stack, from front-end to back-end, and even the underlying infrastructure. This project aims to demystify the journey of a web request from the moment it's initiated by typing a URL in the browser, through various network and server processes, to finally displaying the webpage.

## Project Overview

This repository contains the resources and guidelines for writing an insightful blog post that explains the intricate process of how a web request is handled. It covers essential components such as DNS requests, TCP/IP protocols, firewalls, HTTPS/SSL encryption, load balancers, web servers, application servers, and databases.

## Requirements

- The blog post should be published on a platform of your choice, with LinkedIn or Medium being recommended for their wide reach.
- A `README.md` file is required at the root of this project folder to guide readers.

## Task 0: Exploring the Web Stack

The primary objective is to craft a blog post that sheds light on what happens when you enter `https://www.google.com` in your browser and press Enter. The post must cover the following topics in detail:

- **DNS Request:** How your computer finds the server hosting `www.google.com`.
- **TCP/IP:** The protocols that facilitate data transmission across the internet.
- **Firewall:** Security measures that protect data during its journey.
- **HTTPS/SSL:** Encryption protocols that secure the data exchanged.
- **Load Balancer:** The system that distributes incoming web traffic across multiple servers.
- **Web Server:** The server that handles the request and responds with the appropriate content.
- **Application Server:** The layer that executes the backend logic.
- **Database:** Where data is stored and retrieved from.

## Publishing

After finalizing your blog post, publish it on your chosen platform. Remember to share the URL of your blog post both in your submission file and within this `README.md` to make it accessible to readers and potential employers.

## Conclusion

This project not only serves as a practical exercise in understanding web infrastructure but also as a valuable asset in your portfolio. By articulating the flow of web requests and responses, you demonstrate a comprehensive understanding of web technologies and their interactions.
