Can you explain the distribution algorithm used in our load balancer and how it distributes traffic?
Our load balancer uses a specific algorithm round-robin to evenly distribute incoming traffic among servers, ensuring no single server gets overwhelmed.

Could you describe whether our load balancer is configured for an Active-Active or Active-Passive setup and the differences between them?
In an Active-Active setup, all servers handle traffic simultaneously for efficiency. In an Active-Passive setup, secondary servers are only used if the primary one fails, enhancing reliability.

Can you explain how a database Primary-Replica (Master-Slave) cluster operates?
In this setup, the primary database handles all the write operations and then replicates the data to one or more replica databases that handle read operations, ensuring data redundancy and load distribution.

What is the difference between the Primary node and the Replica node in regards to the application?
The Primary node handles all the write and update operations, while the Replica node handles read operations, ensuring the primary node's load is reduced and read operations are faster and more scalable.

Where are the Single Points of Failure (SPOF) in our infrastructure?
SPOFs might include a single server for the application, database, or web services, where if one fails, the entire system can become unavailable.

Can you identify any security issues in our infrastructure, such as the absence of a firewall or HTTPS?
Without a firewall, our system is vulnerable to unauthorized access, and without HTTPS, data transferred between the client and server is not encrypted, posing a risk of data interception.

How would you address the lack of monitoring in our current setup?
Implementing monitoring tools would allow us to track system performance, detect failures or irregularities, and gather data for optimizing the infrastructure.
