# Issue Summary
On March 5, 2024, from 10:00 AM to 12:45 PM EST, our main web service experienced a significant outage, impacting approximately 65% of our user base. Users reported inability to access their dashboards, experiencing timeouts and slow responses. The root cause was identified as an overloaded database server due to an inefficient query that locked critical tables.

# Timeline
10:00 AM - Issue detected through automated monitoring alerts indicating high latency and error rates.
10:05 AM - Initial assumption focused on a potential DDoS attack. Network traffic patterns were analyzed, showing no abnormalities.
10:20 AM - Customer support reported a surge in complaints about service unavailability, confirming the issue's severity.
10:30 AM - Investigation redirected to database performance. Logs revealed unusual CPU spikes.
10:45 AM - Discovery of a recently deployed feature causing inefficient database queries.
11:00 AM - Escalation to the database management team and senior backend engineers.
11:15 AM - Temporary rollback of the new feature to alleviate immediate pressure on the database.
11:30 AM - Implementation of a hotfix to optimize the problematic query.
12:45 PM - Service restored to full functionality after confirming the stability of the database.

# Root Cause and Resolution
The outage was caused by an inefficient database query introduced with a new feature. This query caused excessive locking of critical tables, leading to a database bottleneck and subsequent service degradation. The resolution involved rolling back the new feature to quickly mitigate the issue, followed by a permanent fix through query optimization and deployment of improved indexing strategies to prevent future occurrences.

# Corrective and Preventative Measures
To prevent a recurrence, we have identified several areas of improvement:

Code Review Processes: Enhance our code review standards, especially for changes affecting database interactions.
Performance Testing: Introduce comprehensive performance testing for all new features, particularly focusing on database load and query efficiency.
Monitoring Enhancements: Expand our monitoring capabilities to include more granular metrics on database performance and query execution times.
Education: Conduct a workshop on best practices for database management and query optimization for our engineering teams.

# TODO List
Patch Database Server: Apply the latest patches and updates to ensure optimal performance and security.
Add Monitoring on Critical Queries: Implement detailed logging and alerting for key database queries to detect inefficiencies early.
Review and Optimize Existing Queries: Conduct a comprehensive audit of current database queries and optimize as necessary.
Deploy Query Performance Testing Tools: Integrate tools for automated performance testing of database queries into our CI/CD pipeline.
Database Management Training for Engineers: Schedule a series of training sessions on database management best practices and query optimization techniques.

This postmortem serves as a commitment to our users and ourselves to learn from incidents and continuously improve our systems and processes. We apologize to all affected users and thank our team for their swift response and resolution of this issue.
