## Web stack debugging #3
The goal of this project is to develop a Puppet manifest that addresses a specific issue encountered while debugging a WordPress site running on a LAMP stack. This involves identifying the problem, formulating a solution, and automating the fix using Puppet. The project will demonstrate the importance of comprehensive debugging techniques and the power of configuration management tools like Puppet in resolving complex web stack issues.

# Concept
Web Server: Understanding the role and configuration of Apache within the LAMP stack.
Web Stack Debugging: Techniques for diagnosing and resolving issues in a WordPress site running on a LAMP stack.

In the realm of web development, debugging can sometimes be more complex than simply reviewing logs. This project focuses on the scenario where traditional debugging methods fall short, necessitating a deeper dive into the web stack. WordPress, a powerful tool for creating a wide range of websites, is commonly deployed on a LAMP stack (Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP). This project aims to equip students with the skills to navigate and resolve issues within such a setup, leveraging Puppet for configuration management.

# Requirements:
- Environment: All work will be conducted on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS.
- File Standards: All files must end with a new line and include a README.md at the project root.
- Puppet Manifests: Manifests must adhere to Puppet v3.4 standards, pass puppet-lint v2.1.1 without errors, and include a descriptive comment at the beginning. They must end with the .pp extension.
