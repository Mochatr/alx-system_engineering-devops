# 0x12. Web Stack Debugging #2

This project is part of the web stack debugging series, focusing on employing and enhancing debugging techniques on a web stack.

## Concepts

The core concept for this project is **Web Stack Debugging**. It aims to equip with the skills and methodologies necessary to identify and resolve common issues within web stack environments.

## Requirements

### General

- All scripts and files are designed to be interpreted/run on **Ubuntu 20.04 LTS**.
- Every file must end with a new line.
- A mandatory `README.md` file is located at the root of the project directory.
- All Bash script files are required to be executable.
- Scripts must pass **Shellcheck** without any errors to ensure best practices and avoid common mistakes.
- Each Bash script is expected to run without errors, fulfilling its intended functionality.
- The first line of all Bash scripts must be `#!/usr/bin/env bash` to ensure portability and use the environment's `bash`.
- The second line of all Bash scripts should contain a comment that explains the script's purpose or action, providing clarity and context.

## Objective

The primary objective of this project is to practice and refine web stack debugging skills. Through hands-on debugging tasks, participants will learn to systematically diagnose and correct issues affecting the functionality and performance of web stacks.

Happy Debugging!
