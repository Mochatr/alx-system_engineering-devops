# Reddit API Practice Project

This project is designed to help you gain a deeper understanding of working with APIs, specifically the Reddit API. It covers a range of topics from basic API calls to more advanced features like pagination, recursive API calls, and data parsing. The project is structured to simulate a real-world scenario where you might need to interact with an API to fetch and process data.

## Objectives

By the end of this project, you should be able to:

- Read API documentation to find the endpoints you're looking for.
- Use an API with pagination to fetch large amounts of data.
- Parse JSON results from an API to extract relevant information.
- Make recursive API calls to fetch data that spans multiple pages.
- Sort a dictionary by value to organize data effectively.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.4.3 installed on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS.
- Basic understanding of Python programming.
- Familiarity with JSON and HTTP requests.

## Acknowledgments
- Reddit API Documentation
- Python `requests` library
- Pagination and recursive API calls concepts

This project will help you to enhance understanding and skills in API integration and data processing. Happy coding!
